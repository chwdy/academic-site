- Currently seeking opportunities for Business/ Data Analysts, consultant, and Frontend developer
- Current student of Industrial engineering at NYU, expect to graduate in May 2021

I am passionate about coding and have proven to be a quick learner. Experienced with R, Python, SQL, and visualizations, I was able to build data models for Data Analysis projects. On top of that, I aced Machine learning projects which require me to do build my own model, perform validation and tuning parameters. In addition, my passion for coding has led me to pick up new coding languages and has allowed me to work on Front End applications.

The following are my technical abilities:
- Programming languages : HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Front End frameworks: Node.JS and ReactJS
